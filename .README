Music Mashup Java by Rebecka Reitmaier 2019

Requirements: Java and Maven

Done with Spring boot, async requests to external APIs.

Run the application: mvn spring-boot:run
Example request: http://localhost:8080/artist?mbid=5b11f4ce-a62d-471e-81fc-a69a8278c7da

Future features:
* Tests (tests should always be done but focused on other tasks now)
* Cashing requests, could be locally or a distributed solution preferably
* Move to cloud where one could scale the application
* To make it more scalable it could be implemented with e.i. Spring WebFlux
